# PAYG

An online pay as you go POS system

## Getting started
The following instructions detail how to run the app

## Prerequisites
You will need to install the Python libraries used by the app.
You can use `pip` to handle installation of dependencies.
I recommend using a virtual environment(`virtualenv`) to install
these libraries.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the app

From the root directory of the project, run
```
cd path_to_project/

python run.py
```

Open a browser (Chrome is good) and type in the URL
displayed in the terminal after running the above command
e.g.
```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
